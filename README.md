# SQL-Portfolio-Project-NBA-Allstar-Break

This project is based on favorite sport (basketball) and is used as a deep dive behind the stats that accompany NBA before they approach the allstar break (the midpoint of the season) . The competitiveness of the NBA is usually at its highest before the allstar break where teams are trying to establish their season and get a picture of how close they are for a playoff push. I have used stats from the games before the 2022-2023 and 2021-2022 all star breaks to determine if teams have improved in certain categories such as scoring, assisting, winning games and more.

The objective that I have set for this project is to derive insights that would help evaluate the improvements or deficiencies that have occurred between last season and this season. These findings can be used to determine where teams should improve upon in the 2nd half of the season to either finish the season a good note or make a last minute playoff push.

I am tasked with:

- Performing some exploratory data analysis.
- What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the team's current standing?
- What the key statistics that are sepearting winning teams from losing teams?
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL.
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations.
- Cleaning the dataset in Excel.

Main Datasets Analyzed:
- 2021-2022 Before_Allstar_Break_Queries (This is mostly defensive/miscellaneous stats)
- 2022-2023 Before_Allstar_Break_Queries (This is mostly defensive/miscellaneous stats)
- 2021-2022 Before_Allstar_Break_Shooting/Scoring_Queries (This is mostly shooting/scoring stats)
- 2022-2023 Before_Allstar_Break_Shooting/Scoring_Queries (This is mostly shooting/scoring stats)
- Allstar_Break (A view that was created by joining the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 pre_allstar_break_game tables)
